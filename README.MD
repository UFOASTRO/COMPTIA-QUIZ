What type of 
motherboard 
socket is used 
to install 
system 
memory? 
Dual inline memory 
module (DIMM). 
2. 
One. 
3. 
How many 
storage 
devices can be 
attached to a 
single SATA 
port? 
What is the 
bandwidth of 
a PCIe v2.0 
x16 graphics 
adapter? 
8 GBps in each 
direction (full
duplex). PCIe v2 
supports 500 MBps 
per lane. 
6. 
4. 
You have a x8 PCIe storage adapter card—can you fit this in a x16 slot? 
Yes—this is referred to as up-plugging. On some motherboards it may only function as a x1 
device though. 
5. 
You are labelling spare parts for inventory. What type of motherboard is displayed 
here?

Both Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX are square form factors, but Mini-ITX is 6.7 inches square, while 
Micro-ATX is 9.6 inches x 9.6 inches. 
You have another part to label for inventory. What category of adapter card is shown in the exhibit?
1. 
A technician has removed an adapter card from a PC. Should the technician obtain and 
install a blanking plate to complete the service operation? 
External 
SATA 
There is also an 
external SATA 
(eSATA) standard for 
the attachment of 
peripheral drives, 
with a 2 m (78 in.) 
cable. You must use 
an eSATA cable to 
connect to an 
external eSATA port; 
you cannot use an 
internal SATA cable. 
eSATAp is a 
nonstandard powered 
port used by some 
vendors that is 
compatible with both 
USB and SATA (with 
an eSATAp cable). The 
USB interface 
dominates the 
external drive market, 
however. 
Yes. The fan system 
is designed to draw 
cool air across the 
motherboard and 
blow out warm air. 
Large holes in the 
chassis disrupt this 
air flow. Also, dust 
will be able to settle 
on the system 
components more 
easily. A blanking 
plate covers the 
empty slot in the 
case.

2. 
You are labelling spare parts for inventory. What type of USB connector is shown in 
the exhibit? 
(Image ©123RF.com) 
USB 2.0 Type B micro. 
3. 
What is the nominal data rate of a USB port supporting Gen 3.2 2x1? 
10 Gbps. 
4. 
True or false? USB-C ports and connectors are compatible with Apple Lightning 
connectors and ports. 
False. An adapter cable is required. 
5. 
A technician connects a single port on a graphics card to two monitors using two 
cables. What type of interface is being used? 
Both DisplayPort and Thunderbolt interfaces support this type of daisy-chaining. 

6.  
A technician is completing a storage upgrade on an older computer. Examining the 
power supply, the technician notices that only two of the five plugs of the type shown 
in the exhibit are connected to devices. What is the purpose of these plugs, and can 
some be left unconnected?
